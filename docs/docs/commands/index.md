# Maester - PowerShell Commands

## Overview
This page lists all the commands available in the Maester PowerShell module.

The Maester PowerShell module is a collection of commands that help you write Pester tests to validate your Microsoft 365 tenant configuration. You can view the Graph API calls for these commands in the [Maester GitHub repository's src folder](https://github.com/maester365/maester/tree/main/src/public). You can also click the `Edit this page` link found in the command's documentation to view the source code for the command.

See the [writing Maester tests](./writing-tests) guide for more information on how to write your own tests using these commands.
