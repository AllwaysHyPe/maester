## Introduction

This guide is for anyone who wants to contribute to the Maester project. Whether you want to contribute to the code, documentation, or just have an idea for a new feature, we welcome your input.

Follow the guide below to set up Maester for development on your local machine, make changes, and submit a pull request.

## Maester PowerShell module dev guide

### Simple debugging

- Set a breakpoint anywhere in the code and hit F5
- The launch.json has been configured to re-load the module

### Manual editing

- Load the PowerShell module. This needs to be done anytime you make changes to the code in `./powershell`.
  - `Import-Module ./powershell/Maester.psd1 -Force`
- Run Maester
  - `Invoke-Maester`

### Pester Tests

- Tests for the Maester module are at /powershell/tests
- When making changes to the module you can run the test locally by running `/powershell/tests/pester.ps1`
- The **PSScriptAnalyzer**, **PSFramework** and **PSModuleDevelopment** modules are required to run the tests, install them with `Install-Module PSFramework, PSModuleDevelopment, PSScriptAnalyzer`
- The tests are run automatically on PRs and commits to the main branch and will fail if the tests do not pass

## Contributing to Maester docs

Simple edits can be made in the GitHub UI by selecting the `Edit this page` link at the bottom of each page or you can browse to the [docs](https://github.com/maester365/maester/tree/main/website/docs) folder on GitHub.

For more complex changes, you can fork the repository and submit a pull request.

### Running documentation locally

The [Maester.dev](https://maester.dev) website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

Follow this guide if you want to run the documentation locally and view changes in real-time.

#### Pre-requisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above (which can be checked by running node -v). When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

#### Installation

When running the documentation for the first time, you will need to install the dependencies. This can be done by running the following command in ./docs folder.

```
npm install
```

#### Starting the site

While in the ./docs folder run the following command to start the site locally. This will start a local server and open the site in your default browser to http://localhost:3000/

```
npm start
```

#### Editing content

You will now be able to edit add and edit markdown files in the ./website/docs folder and see the changes in real-time in your browser.

- Read the [markdown documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) for more information on some of the custom markdown features available.
- You can search for icons at [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) and include them in the markdown. See the [Daily Automation](https://measter.dev/docs/automation/) page for examples.
- The `Command Reference` section is auto-generated. To update the documentation for this, the .ps1 file for the command needs to be updated with comment-based documentation.
