# Restrict anonymous users from joining meetings

## Description

> By restricting anonymous users from joining Microsoft Teams meetings, you have full control over meeting access. Anonymous users may not be from your organization and could have joined for malicious purposes, such as gaining information about your organization through conversations.

## How to fix

> 1. Log into Microsoft Teams admin center
> 2. In the left navigation, go to Meetings > Meeting Settings
> 3. Under the Participants section, toggle “Anonymous users can join a meeting” to Off
