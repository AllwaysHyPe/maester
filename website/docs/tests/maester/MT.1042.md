# Restrict dial-in users from bypassing a meeting lobby

## Description

> Dial-in users aren’t authenticated though the Teams app. Increase the security of your meetings by preventing these unknown users from bypassing the lobby and immediately joining the meeting.

## How to fix

> 1. Log into Microsoft Teams admin center
> 2. In the left navigation, go to Meetings > Meeting Policies
> 3. Under Manage Policies, select a group/direct policy
> 4. Under the Participants & guests section, toggle "Allow dial-in users to bypass the lobby" to Off
> 5. You’ll need to change this setting for each group/direct policy
