# Microsoft 365 Group (and Team) creation should be restricted to approved users

## Description

By default, all users can create Microsoft 365 Groups. This can lead to sprawl, security risks and compliance issues.

Creating groups should be restricted to users who have undergone training and understand the responsibilities of group ownership, governance and compliance requirements.

## How to fix

Unfortunately, Microsoft 365 does not provide a user interface to restrict group creation. However, you can restrict group creation to approved users by using PowerShell.

Follow the link below to restrict Microsoft 365 Group creation to approved users:.
