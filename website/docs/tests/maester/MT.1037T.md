# Only users with Presenter role are allowed to present in Teams meetings

> Secure Score Name: Configure which users are allowed to present in Teams meetings

## Description

> Only allow users with presenter rights to share content during meetings. Restricting who can present limits meeting disruptions and reduces the risk of unwanted or inappropriate content being shared.

## How to fix

> 1. Log into Microsoft Teams admin center
> 2. In the left navigation, go to Meetings > Meeting Policies
> 3. Under Manage Policies, select a group/direct policy
> 4. Under Content sharing section, toggle "Who can present" to Only organizers and co-organizers
> 5. Youâ€™ll need to change this setting for each group/direct policy
