# Limit external participants from having control in a Teams meeting

## Description

> External participants are users that are outside your organization. Limiting their permission to share content, add new users, and more protects your organization’s information from data leaks, inappropriate content being shared, or malicious actors joining the meeting.

## How to fix

> 1. Log into Microsoft Teams admin center
> 2. In the left navigation, go to Meetings > Meeting Policies
> 3. Under Manage Policies, select a group/direct policy
> 4. Under the Content Sharing section, toggle "Allow an external participant to give or request control" to Off
> 5. You’ll need to change this setting for each group/direct policy
