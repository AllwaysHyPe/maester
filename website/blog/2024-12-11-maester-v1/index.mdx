We [launched Maester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfs02tjSU24) at the PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit in March this year and it has been an amazing journey since then.

Here are some quick stats for you:
* 🚀 100,000+ downloads on PowerShell Gallery
* 🌐 17,000 monthly visitors to [maester.dev](https://maester.dev)
* 💻 1,800+ commits on GitHub
* 🤝 48+ contributors
* ✳️ 194 Maester tests
* 📦 155 releases

We have added a lot of new features and improvements based on your feedback. Thank you for that! 🙏

### Here are some of the major new features we've added since our first release in March.


* **New tests**: We've almost doubled the number of tests going from 96 to 194 today. Check out the [test list](https://github.com/maester365/maester/blob/main/docs/tests.md) for the full list. Two very special mentions for the tests are:
  * [Mike → @soulemike](https://github.com/soulemike) - Mike started adding CISA tests to Maester the very next day at the PowerShell conference. Since then he's done an amazing job of contributing code, replying to issues both on GitHub and the Discord channel. Maester wouldn't be where it is today without Mike. Thanks Mike!
  * [Ben → @NZLostboy](https://github.com/NZLostboy) - Ben took it upon himself to start adding the CIS benchmark tests to Maester and is our #6 highest contributor. Thank you Ben for the insane amount of value you've added to Maester!
* **Maester GitHub Action**: [Fabian → @f-bader](https://github.com/f-bader) - Fabian built the [Maester - GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/maester-action) that greatly simplified the process of setting up and running Maester on GitHub and he managed to get it done in time for the Powershell + DevOps Europe Summit. Thank you Fabian!
* **Test doc updates**: Improvements to the remediation steps for each test to make it easier to understand and fix failing tests. TODO: Jan Bakker,etc..
