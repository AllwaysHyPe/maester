Built-in protection policies provide catch-all protection against users not covered by higher order policies. Excluding users from the built-in protection policies may mean these users have reduced protections. It is important not to rely on the 'built-in' policies, as these policies only apply the minimum level of protections and should serve as a catch-all.

#### Remediation action
Remove exclusions from the built-in protection policies.
